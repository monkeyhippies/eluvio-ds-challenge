## DS Challenge

This is my Eluvio DS challenge repo. It contains `ds-challenge.ipynb`, which is a jupyter notebook containing all the work I did. It can be run with jupyter. Also, there's an `assets/` directory that contains a website of the jupyter notebook after it has run to completion, including code outputs and graphs. This can be viewed by opening the file `assets/__notebook_source__.html` file with Chrome
